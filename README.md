# Poap-for-Core-Contributors
A poap for the core contributors of the Poapathon
This Poap is designed to look like an eclipse. The solar eclipse is an astronomical event that occurs when the sun, moon and earth are aligned. Using this as a metaphor, I designed this eclipse (using the Poapathon branding), to represent how the Poapathon contributors have come together from completely different specialisms. Designers, builders, engineers, volunteers. The title (Core contributors) is framed by two helping hands, to represent unity and volunteering.
